# Testing

## Create Config
You must create a config.json file in this folder:
* Copy the config.sample.json
* Rename to config.json
* Complete the settings

You can now run any test script directly in VSCode or run the _InvokeTests.ps1 script to execute all tests

## Results
Test results are published to TestResults.xml in this directory (ignored by gitignore)
